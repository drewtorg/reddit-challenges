# reddit-challenges
A collection of answers to the /r/dailyprogrammer challenges

I found this nifty subreddit and decided to try my hand at some of them in between school projects.  They're fairly simple, but usually quite interesting as well.  In each folder is a source.txt or src.txt that contatins a link to the original post if you want to see what the challenge is all about.
